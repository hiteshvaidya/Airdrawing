Requirements:
Processing IDE

Programming Language:
Java

Description:
This is marker based Augmented Reality application.
patt.hiro is the marker in this case.
.pde is file extension for Processing program

When the program is run in processing, it takes input from webcam. When the marker is brought into frame, it tracks this marker and augments a black dot in the middle. This process continues in each frame at given frame rate. When a new dot is augmented, the old one is not cleared, it remains as it is. When the marker is moved in 3D space, dots are augmented on the path followed. The overall effect is such that, it appears as if marker is a brush and a coloured line is drawn by moving this brush.
